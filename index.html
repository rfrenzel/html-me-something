			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>My exposure to fine wine started in 1996 while I was employed as a retail price analyst for a local chain of liquor store in Overland Park, Kansas. I became friends with the retail sales manager, who had an extensive fine wine sales background, and it was through discussions with him that my interest began. After a year and a half of self-study I tested for and received my Sommelier certification in September, 1998. I continued to work in fine wine sales at the retail level for two years, then obtained a position with Kendall-Jackson wine estates in Chicago, Illinois, and ended my foray into wine sales back here in Kansas City with Glazer's Midwest, a local wine distributor. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Throughout my time in wine sales I came to understand just how many people were either intimidated by wine or simply embarrassed about their lack of wine knowledge, so with that in mind...below is my brief attempt to allay those fears and provide a basic understanding about the principles of wine:</p>
			<br>
			<p><h4>Let's first discuss a broad difference between the styles of wine available for purchase:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Still wine - what people tradtionally think of as wine, whether red, white or blush.</li>
					<li>Sparkling wine - simply put...wine that has bubbles due to the dissolved gas contained therein. Sparkling wines, essentially, begin as still wines (although not very palatable!) until a method is applied to introduce the gas into the wine. The are 4 methods to do this, but only one-the <em>M&eacutethode Champenoise</em>-is considered to be "of quality". </li>
					<li>Fortified wine - is still wine that has had an alcohol distallate added to it, hence "fortified". Examples of fortified wines are brandies, ports, sherries, madieras and marsalas.</li>
					<li>Aromasized wine - is a fortified wine that has had herbs, spices or berries added to it. Vermouth is the best example of an aromasized wine.</li>
				</ul></p>
			<br>
			<p><h4>Next, a brief pr&eacutecis on the broad division between the types of grapes used to make wine:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Vitis vinifera</em> - grape varieties that orignated in Europe, e.g. Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Noir.</li>
					<li><em>Vitis labrusca</em> - grape varities that originated in eastern North America, e.g. Concord and Catawba.</li>
					<li><em>Vitis aestivalis</em> - grape varieties that orignated in the midwest of North America, e.g. Norton.</li>
					<li>Hybrids - cross-breeds of European and American grapes, e.g. Seyval and Vignoles</li>
				</ul>

					Since the vast majority of "fine" wine sold in the world is of <em>Vitis vinifera</em> the below will concentrate only on a few grapes belonging to this family.	
			</p></h4>
			<br>
			<p><h4>Lastly, I will touch on the two broad divisions of wine sold in the world:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Old World Wines - wines that originate in regions within Europe made by grapes culivated there, e.g. Bordeux, Burgundy, Alsace, Tuscany, Rioja, etc. .</li>
					<li>New World Wines - wines that originate everywhere outside of Europe by grapes culivated where ever, e.g. California, Australia, South American, South Africa, etc.</li>
				</ul>
			The primary reason to mention this distinction is really very simple...Old World wines are named for the regions from which they come, and New World wines are named for the variety of grape that is used. It's really that simple!
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Admittedly the immediately above is simple only when applied to New World wines...you have to understand the Old World wine regions to know what grapes are being culivated there, and here is where Old World wines get complex. To make this brief I will concentrate on one wine region: the vaunted, and heralded Bordeux region of France.</p>

			<h2>Bordeaux</h2>
			<p>The Bordeux region of France produces the most recognizable names of fine wine. Typically, these wines fetch <strong>high</strong> prices at auction, which is probably why their names are so recognizable: Chateau Mouton Rothchild, Chateau Haut Brion, Chateau Margaux, Chateau Cheval Blanc, Chateau Petrus, etc. The Gironde river delineates two distinct areas of the Bordeaux <em>Appellation D'Origin Controlle</em>, or <em>AOC</em>, the area that defines the Bordeaux region (by law) into the West and East banks.
			By mandate of French law (the WHOLE of Europe mandates by law the culivation and production of their wines) there are only five grape varieties that are allowed to be culivated and included into the final blend of a Bordeux wine:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="Cabernet Sauvignon">Cabernet Sauvignon</a></li>
			<li><a href="Merlot">Merlot</a></li>
			<li><a href="Cabernet Franc">Cabernet Franc</a></li>
			<li><a href="Malbec">Malbec</a></li>
			<li><a href="Petit Verdot">Petit Verdot</a></li>
		</ul>
