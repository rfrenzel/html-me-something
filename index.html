			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>My exposure to fine wine started in 1996 while I was employed as a retail price analyst for a local chain of liquor store in Overland Park, Kansas. I became friends with the retail sales manager, who had an extensive fine wine sales background, and it was through discussions with him that my interest began. After a year and a half of self-study I tested for and received my Sommelier certification in September, 1998. I continued to work in fine wine sales at the retail level for two years, then obtained a position with Kendall-Jackson wine estates in Chicago, Illinois, and ended my foray into wine sales back here in Kansas City with Glazer's Midwest, a local wine distributor. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Throughout my time in wine sales I came to understand just how many people were either intimidated by wine or simply embarrassed about their lack of wine knowledge, so with that in mind...below is my brief attempt to allay those fears and provide a basic understanding about the principles of wine:</p>
			<br>
			<p>Let's first discuss a broad difference between the styles of wine available for purchase:
				<ul>
					<li>Still wine - what people tradtionally think of as wine, whether red, white or blush.</li>
					<li>Sparkling wine - simply put...wine that has bubbles due to the dissolved gas contained therein. Sparkling wines, essentially, begin as still wines (although not very palatable!) until a method is applied to introduce the gas into the wine. The are 4 methods to do this, but only one-the <em>M&eacutethode Champenoise</em>-is considered to be "of quality". </li>
					<li>Fortified wine - is still wine that has had an alcohol distallate added to it, hence "fortified". Examples of fortified wines are brandies, ports, sherries, madieras and marsalas.</li>
					<li>Aromasizd wine - is a fortified wine that has had herbs, spices or berries added to it. Vermouth is the best example of an aromasized wine.</li>
				</ul></p>
			<br>
			<p>Next, a brief pr&eacutecis on the broad division between the types of grapes used to make wine:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Vitis vinifera</em> - grape varieties that orignated in Europe, e.g. Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Noir.</li>
					<li><em>Vitis labrusca</em> - grape varities that originated in eastern North America, e.g. Concord and Catawba.</li>
					<li><em>Vitis aestivalis</em> - grape varieties that orignated in the midwest of North America, e.g. Norton.</li>
					<li>Hybrids - cross-breeds of European and American grapes, e.g. Seyval and Vignoles</li>
				</ul>
